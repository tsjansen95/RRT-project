# RRT-project
Robot Arm Planning Using Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees

For running the program:

- The src folder contains all necessary classes to run the project. 

- mintools.jar, vecmath.jar, jogl-all.jar, and gleugen-rt.jar must be included in the             
  build path in order for the program to run. 

- jogl-all.jar and gleugen-rt.jar should be kept in the jar folder alongside all the 
  natives jar files.

- In order for the libraries to work properly, a 64-bit JVM should be used.

- To run the program, run the ProjectApp class as a Java Application.

- The description of how to use the user interface is included in the RRTpaper PDF.
